   :alt: Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.

**Warning:** This project is a **Work In Progress**.

The goal of this project is to create a fixed-width  `bitmap <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font#BITMAP>`_ font specialized for making board game diagrams.  The `duospaced <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duospaced_font>`_ version is called **Game Bit Duo** while the square `monospaced <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font>`_ version is called **Game Bit Mono**.

Intended Features
-----------------

`My wishlist for a font that does not seem to exist yet <http://trevorldavis.com/piecepackr/unicode-piecepack-diagrams.html#piecepack-font-wishlist>`_:  

* A fixed-width duospaced font.
* Characters intended for use in diagrams will generally be square (aka "fullwidth").

  * Some blocks such as Basic Latin will be "halfwidth" to better support text rendering.

* Needs to have the important piecepack rank/suit Unicode symbols including support for all rotated versions of the glyphs. These symbols must still look nice when combining with Combining Diacritical Marks used as directional marks plus an enclosing circle, square, diamond, and/or triangle. 
* Would also be nice to include the relevant "rotated" Unicode 12.0 chess piece glyphs (useful as piecepack Crowns and pawns).
* Needs support for all the thin/thick box-drawing characters. These should combine well with the piecepack coins, dice, and pawns (i.e. enclosing circles, squares, etc.) so it looks like those pieces are truly on top of the tiles (so no lines going through the "edge" of the coins, dice, pawns or awkward gaps between lines and piece "edges").

Target game systems
-------------------

The font will aim to support making diagrams for every game system supported by the R function `ppgames::cat_piece() <https://trevorldavis.com/R/ppgames/dev/reference/cat_piece.html>`_ which generates Unicode plaintext game diagrams:

* [X] `checkers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_draughts>`_

  + U+26C0 through U+26C3 are "standard" checkers/draughts pieces.
  + As an alternative U+25CF is "black circle" and U+25CB" is "white circle"
    while U+24C0 and U+1F15A are circled uppercase K's.

* [X] `chess <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess>`_

  + U+2654 through U+265F are "standard" chess pieces
  + "Chess Symbols" block has Xiangqi and "fairy" chess pieces

* [X] `dice <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice>`_

  + U+2680 through U+2685 are "standard" die faces
  + Can use U+20DE "Combining Enclosing Square" to make non-standard die faces

* [X] `dominoes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes>`_

  + "Domino Tiles" block is included but not recommended for diagrams.
    Instead make 3x5 or 5x3 glyph dominoes.  
    Adjacent dominoes will share "Box Drawing" outline glyphs.
    Use the following "Private Use Area" glyphs for pips:

    - 0 Pips: U+FCA00
    - 1 Pip:  U+FCA01
    - 2 Pips: U+FCA02 / U+FCA12
    - 3 Pips: U+FCA03 / U+FCA13
    - 4 Pips: U+FCA04
    - 5 Pips: U+FCA05
    - 6 Pips: U+FCA06 / U+FCA16
    - 7 Pips: U+FCA07 / U+FCA17
    - 8 Pips: U+FCA08
    - 9 Pips: U+FCA09

    .. image:: png/dominoes_mono.png

* [X] `go <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>`_

  + U+25CF is "black circle" and U+25CB" is "white circle"
  + U+2686 through U+2689 are "Go markers"
  + Several circled numbers and letters in "Dingbats", "Enclosed Alphanumerics",
    and "Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement" blocks that can be used for annotation.

    .. image:: png/go_mono.png

* [X] `Icehouse pieces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icehouse_pieces>`_

  + One may crudely refer to Icehouse pieces by using smaller squares and triangles from "Geometric Shapes" block
    plus using a combining 1/2/3 dots beneath.

    + Square indicates standing pyramid.
    + Triangle laid down pyramid, where it points is where the pyramid points.
    + Number of dots beneath indicate number of pips on the pyramid.
    + This is enough to visualize certain abstracts like `Martian Chess <https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/martian-chess>`__ and `Pikemen <https://www.icehousegames.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pikemen>`__ but not enough to visualize games where you stack pyramids on one another.

* [ ] `piecepack <https://www.ludism.org/ppwiki>`_

  + [X] base piecepack
  + [X] playing cards expansion
  + [X] dual piecepacks expansion
  + [X] four seasons expansion?
  + [ ] elements expansion?
  + [X] stackpack subpack?
  + [ ] piecepack matchsticks?
  + [ ] piecepack pyramids?

* [X] miscellaneous abstracts

  + Can use any of the above game pieces
  + "Geometric Shapes" block has a variety of shapes that can be used for abstracts

* [ ] others?
